# A Full Stack dApps with React, Ethers.js, Solidity, and Hardhat

This project is an example of smart contracts development with Ethereum. It encompases the best stack for building full stack dApps with React, Ethers.js, Solidity and Hardhat.  

<i>You do not need to own any Ethereum for this guide as we will be using fake / test Ether on a test network</i>

This project was inspired by an [article](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13) by [Nader Dabit](https://dev.to/dabit3).

-  Ethereum development environment - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)  
-  Ethereum Web Client Library - [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)    
-  API layer - [The Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/)
